## Data View

### Product

A product is a tangible or intangible item or service that is created, designed, or offered to fulfill a need or want of a target market. It can range from physical goods such as consumer products or industrial equipment to non-physical offerings like software, services, or experiences, with the ultimate goal of satisfying customer needs and generating value for both the producer and the consumer.

### Customer

A customer is an individual, entity, or organization that engages in a transaction or interaction with a business, service provider, or product supplier. Customers play a pivotal role in the economic exchange by expressing needs, preferences, and demands for goods, services, or experiences. They are the end users or beneficiaries of the offerings provided by businesses, and their interactions can involve purchasing, using, or evaluating products or services. Understanding and meeting customer needs are central to the success of businesses and the satisfaction of individuals or entities involved in the exchange.

### Order

An order refers to a directive or request made by a customer or entity to acquire a product or service from a supplier or provider. It is a formalized instruction that outlines the specific details of the desired transaction, including the type and quantity of products or services, delivery terms, and any other relevant specifications. An order serves as a contractual agreement between the buyer and the seller, establishing the terms and conditions under which the exchange will take place. The process of placing and fulfilling orders is fundamental to commerce and business transactions, facilitating the organized exchange of goods and services.

### Payment Instruction

A payment instruction is a formalized communication or directive provided by a payer to initiate a financial transaction. It is a set of instructions that specify the details of a payment, including the amount to be transferred, the recipient or payee, the method of payment, and any other relevant information such as reference numbers or payment terms. Payment instructions are crucial for the orderly transfer of funds in various financial transactions, encompassing activities such as purchasing goods or services, settling debts, or making investments. These instructions can be conveyed through various channels, including online banking platforms, written documents, electronic payment systems, or other means, depending on the context and the available financial infrastructure.

### Credit Card

a credit card is a financial tool that enables the cardholder to borrow funds up to a predetermined credit limit to make purchases or transactions. It is a plastic card with a magnetic stripe or chip, issued by a financial institution, such as a bank or credit card company. The cardholder can use the credit card to make payments at merchants that accept it, and the amount spent is essentially a short-term loan.

Key elements of a credit card include:

* Credit Limit: The maximum amount a cardholder can borrow using the credit card.
* Issuer: The financial institution that provides the credit card.
* Cardholder: The individual to whom the credit card is issued.
* Interest Rate: The cost of borrowing if the cardholder does not pay the full balance by the due date.
* Billing Cycle: The period between credit card statements, typically a month.
