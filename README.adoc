= C4 PlantUML Helper Macro

Getting up to speed with C4 is easy peasy and before you know it you have more diagram scripts than you can shake a stick at.

The issue then becomes:

* how do you standardise on alias and label names used?
* how do you pickup and maintain common descriptions?
* how easy is it to add navigational links as the C4 maker had intended?
* How do we maintain and integrate all these scripts so to produce a “Model” of the architecture.

C4_Helper to the rescue.

In this example there is a mix of components defined using the helper macro and normal C4 coded components.

== Installation Notes
The C4_helper.iuml is a PlantUML Preprocessor and requires the V2 of the https://plantuml.com/preprocessing[plantuml preprocessor] and at least release  of 1.2020.07.

An updated C4 Code Snippet is included which cater for the new helper routines introduced.
The following variable are used

[options="header",cols="<.<2,<.<1, <.<4"]
|===
|Variable|Value|Behaviour
| $INCLUDE_DESC| Y | Incldues description of object from respective registry. If the variable is not set or initialised to another value, descriptions are not shown.
.3+|$C4_LEVEL|CONTEXT| Container objects will have the link as per the container registary
|CONTAINER|Container objects will have a link based on the assocated context identifier. Component objects will contain a link based on teh component registry.
|COMPONENT|Components will link back to the associated container. 
|===

== Future Considerations
The scripts have been coded to support the externalisation of the Context, Container and Compoenent registries. 
The json based regesistries are currrently imbedded within the helper script pending plantumls release of the *%loadJSON("context.json")* function.

I will endevour to source a confluence sandpit site to demonstrate the linakability between the C4 levels.
